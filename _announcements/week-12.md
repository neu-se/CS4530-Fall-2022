The [final project deliverabes](/CS4530-Fall-2022/Assignments/project-deliverable) were published few weeks ago. These include details regarding submission of the final project (i.e., code/testing, report, posters and demos). Canvas assingments for these are now available too.

Each instructor has also provided detailed list of expectations for the final demos. Those can be viewed [here](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/119279/assignments/1609070).
