The [revised project plan](/CS4530-Fall-2022/assignments/revised-project-plan) is now available. Please note that there are several aspects of the assignment that have additional details compared to the preliminary plan: each condition of satisfaction must have a priority, and the work breakdown should be updated based upon your activities so far.

Please also find the [instructions for creating your team project repo](/CS4530-Fall-2022/assignments/project-overview#creating-a-github-repository) now available on the project overview page. Following these instructions, you will create a private repository on GitHub that will start out with the solution to the individual project.
