On behalf of the entire instructional team (all 3 instructors and 12 TAs), welcome to the Fall 2022 edition of CS 4530! [This website](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2022/) will contain all of the lectures, assignments and tutorials for the class. Our [Canvas site](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/119279) contains your gradebook as well as single-sign-on links to Piazza (for discussion), GradeScope (for submitting assignments) and replicates much of the material on the class website.

In advance of the first week of class, we've shared the [calendars for each section](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2022/calendar/), the first two lectures, and the [first individual project deliverable](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2022/assignments/ip1). We are excited to meet you all this week!
